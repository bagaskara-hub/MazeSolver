# Maze Solver

![screenshot](DS_OOP_Poster_MazeSolver.png)

## Overview
A **maze solver** is a program or algorithm that finds a path from the **start** point to the **end** point 
in a maze by navigating through open spaces and avoiding walls or obstacles.
This maze solver program allows its users to generate a random maze and solve it! 

This maze solver program solves mazes using two algorithms:
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** using a stack
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** using a queue

## Files included:
- `MazeSolver.java`: Contains logic for generating and solving the maze
- `MazeSolverApp.java`: A Swing-based GUI to visualize the maze and run the solvers

## Features:
- Generate random mazes
- Solve with BFS (queue data structure) or DFS (stack data structure)
- Show solution path, visited nodes, and performance statistics (time and memory)
- Easy-to-use graphical interface

## How to run:
1. Download the source code (MazeSolver.java and MazeSolverApp.java).
2. Open the files in a suitable Java IDE and make sure that the files are all in the same directory.
3. Run the MazeSolverApp.java file!
